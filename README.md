# Microdox mk1

With this keymap I try to accomplish a couple of things:

- Keep qwerty my main layout for now
- Minimal number of layers for usability
- Mods on every layer (home row mods except for SHIFT)
- Easy sync between my Microdox and Moonlander
- Minimize pinky use on both sides

I've tried combos for TAB and ENTER on DF and JK and it felt pretty good but for now I try to map my keyboard without combos for ergonomic reasons.
