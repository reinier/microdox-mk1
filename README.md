# Microdox mk1

With this [QMK](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm) keymap I try to accomplish a couple of things:

- Keep qwerty my main layout for now
- Only use 36 keys
- Minimal number of layers for usability
- Mods on every layer ([home row mods](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods) except for SHIFT)
- Easy sync between my [Microdox](https://boardsource.xyz/store/5f2e7e4a2902de7151494f92) and [Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/) ([my Moonlander keymap](https://github.com/reinier/moonlander-mk1)) by adding an extra mapping in `definekeys.c`
- Minimize pinky use on both sides for ergonomic reasons

I've tried combos for TAB and ENTER on DF and JK and it felt pretty good but for now I try to map my keyboard without combos for ergonomic reasons.

How it looks now:
